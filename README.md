# KlimSalaBim

KlimSalaBim is an initiative to offset your carbon footprints and save environment.

## Problem:

Many activities such as air travel cause climate-damaging CO₂ emissions. Climate change and global warming are significant challenges of the 21st century. Kyoto Protocol (1997) regards the market mechanism as a way to solve the greenhouse gas emission reduction problem and therefore carbon dioxide emission is considered a commodity- forming a transparent carbon trading system.

## Our solution

Carbon offsetting allows companies or individuals to reduce carbon emissions by purchasing carbon credits from carbon reduction projects. These projects include planting trees, avoiding deforestation, investing in renewable energy, and carbon capture.

KlimSalaBim enables users to reduce their carbon footprint by buying Carbon certificates and retiring them using Toucan smart contracts.

## How It's Made

Architecture:

- Toucan helper contracts for retiring carbon certificates
- KlimSalaBim smart contracts accumulates the total emissions 
- Next.js App which enables users interact with klimsalabim.sol and Toucan protocol helpers

Technologies

- UI - Next.js, React, HTML/CSS
- Smart Contract - Solidity ERC-721, Toucan Protocol Helper classes
- Programmable Cashflows - Superfluid (Future roadmap)
- Backend - web3.js, Node.js
- Art Design - Adobe PhotoShop, Adobe Illustrator
- Testnet - Mumbai Polygon , Polygon Mainnet (Future roadmap)
- Tools - Brownie, Coinbase SDK, Metamask

## Future Implementation Ideas

- Streaming functionality to compensate for the stay of the participant at the event (Retire at the end) empowered by Superfluid Protocol.
- NFT claiming functionality from Toucan Protocol and extending it with information about the event.
- Use EPNS to inform participants for when the contribution period has been closed and they can, for example, view the final version of their (dynamic, SVG-based) NFT.
